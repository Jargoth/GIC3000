# GIC3000

Everthing started ass a highschool project. Me and my friend was trying to make a small LED-display,
that could be controlled from a computer. We called it GIC2000. We failed to get it to work, but we
where close. A few years later I resumed the project and got it to work. The project was named GIC3000.
Unfortunatly I lost the sourcecode in a harddrive crash. But I managed to get the machine-code from the
microcontroller as well as a dump of the eeprom. The display will show santa in a sled dragged by
raindeers moving across the display, and if any information is sent from the computer it displays
that instead.

It uses a ATMEGA8535 microcontroller. The program is written in assembler.
